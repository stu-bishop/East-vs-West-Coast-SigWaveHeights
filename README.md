This Jupyter Notebook was motivated from teaching MEA 464/591 Ocean Circulation Systems.  In introducing the students to using xarray and opendap we were able to answer the question of whether the east coast had bigger waves from the recent El Nino-fueled storms in winter 2023-2024 than Southern California.
